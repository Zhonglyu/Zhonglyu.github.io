### Project Overview

During my time at JLL, I developed a robust data pipeline to monitor commercial asset data in real-time.

### Key Achievements

- **High-Volume Data Collection**: Developed Python-based web crawlers to collect over **20,000+ data points** from various real estate sources.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implemented **Redis** for incremental weekly updates and real-time monitoring, ensuring data freshness.
- **Data Quality Control**: Built an automated cleaning program that identified limitations in token-based classification and proposed a geo-coordinate cross-verification improvement.
- **Impact**: Successfully corrected over **700+ inaccuracies** in the company database of 13,000+ entries.

### Technologies Used
- **Python** (Scrapy, Selenium, Pandas)
- **Redis**
- **SQL**
